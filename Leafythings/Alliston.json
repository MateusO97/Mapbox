Gone are the days where you have to wait around for a text from a friend of a friend. Today, East Toronto residents enjoy access to a massive sock of high quality cannabis products featuring both quality and variety that were previously inaccessible to most consumers. So, why should you choose a delivery service over a stop down to your local dispensary? There are a few key advantages;[/p][h2]Unbeatable Prices[/h2][p]With hundreds of cannabis companies operating in the greater Toronto region, consumers may find that browsing listings and checking prices is a tedious process. With Leafythings, we make it easy to compare the price and product listings form top rated cannabis delivery services. This makes it easy to find the best deal on the cannabis products you want.[/p][h2]Fast, Same-Day Weed Delivery[/h2][p]At minimum, most vendors provide same-day delivery. But by choosing a local vendor you can have your cannabis delivered anywhere in East Toronto in as little as 2 hours. Rates and timelines vary from one delivery service to another, but by taking advantage of the map view you can easily find trustworthy weed delivery services conveniently located close to you. With verified listings located throughout the GTA, you can get the selection of a large mail order chain without the long wait times.[/p][h2]Discreet Service[/h2][p]Many of our verified vendors are known for providing professional, discreet service. While cannabis use has certainly become more mainstream, there is still a lot of stigma. For many users, this means that a simple and discreet transaction can be a huge advantage. [/p][h2]How do I order Weed delivery in East Toronto?[/h2][p]Once you've found a company you'd like to order from, you'll need to check their policies about identification and payment. Vendors need to verify that you are of legal smoking age. Some companies require that you send over a scan of your ID before your first order. Others check it at the door. You'll also want to find out what payment methods are accepted. Not all vendors can take credit cards. Many will accept cash on delivery, others offer Interac e-transfer.  Additioanlly, most vendors will offer free delivery provided you make a minimum order. So if you're planning to stock up, this is a great way to save a little money. Payment methods and terms are clearly marked on each vendors profile, so it's easy to find out what you need to know before ordering.[/p]","plNeighbourhood":"Downtown Toronto east of Yonge Street"}},{"bizBusinessID":"BIZ:1e30e295-9cd1-4443-95b9-64f3dfe69513","bizUserID":"USR:0c9c3f80-97b2-4ba1-a2ef-e019de21f4db","bizBusinessTypeID":1,"bizName":"FARMERSLINK (MISSISSAUGA) 1 HR FREE DELIVERY","bizSlug":"farmerslink-1-hr-free-delivery12","bizPhone":"6478688888","bizEmailAddress":"thefarmerslink@gmail.com","bizRegionID":7,"bizRegistrationIP":"184.147.79.29","bizPostal":null,"bizStreetAddress":null,"bizIntersection":"Eglinton Ave E and Hurontario","bizLicenseNumber":null,"bizDescription":"<p>*******FREE DELIVERY*******</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please call/text<strong> (437) 245 - 6043</strong> or visit <strong>(www. farmerslink .ca)</strong> to place your order today!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FREE SAME-DAY DELIVERY<strong> (North York/Toronto West/York/Etobicoke/Brampton/Barrie/Scarborough/Hamilton)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minimum order of $30 + $5 delivery fee OR order over $70 to get free delivery. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>-----------------------------------</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How To Order:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Text/Call<strong> (437) 245 - 6043 </strong>with the following information:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Full Name</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Working Phone Number</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Goverment-Issued Photo ID (for new customers)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Full address for delivery </p>\r\n\r\n<p>- CASH on delivery only</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>OR place an order online at<strong> (www. farmerslink. ca)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Once you place an order, we will text/call you to confirm your photo ID.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Photo ID is required before every order so we can confirm that you are 19+ before your order can be placed.

However, with the weed delivery companies that we feature on Leafy Things, you’d never know it! You can get the same, high quality cannabis products that customers in the bigger cities are getting, delivered right to your door. Here’s how it all works. [/p]","storeplDescription2":"[h2] How Does Weed Delivery in Barrie Work? [/h2][p] Currently, we feature almost two dozen weed delivery companies on Leafythings that serve Barrie, Ontario and any peripheral towns. Once you select a company from one of our featured listings, you’ll be able to view their entire menu of products. Once you’ve decided on a purchase, just click through to visit their website or call by phone to place the order. During the order process, you’ll need to provide your Barrie address to be delivered to. Some companies even offer same day delivery for when you really need it! If you order from a company that doesn’t offer same day delivery, you can expect your order in a day or two, delivered straight to your door in a discrete, smell proof package. Last step? Enjoy! That’s how easy it is. [/p][h2] Okay, but What Weed do I Order? [/h2][p] This is a tough question for us to answer for you! Cannabis preferences can be both highly subjective and personal. However - we can definitely tell you what other people like you in Barrie usually enjoy and like to purchase, and that is a great place to start! High quality flower is a bit of a specialty for the area, so strains such as Do Si Dos, OG Kush and Gorilla Glue are often crowd favourites. Folks in Barrie also really enjoy delicious cannabis infused edibles such as gummies and chocolates. These are two great ways to get your cannabis since you don’t need to smoke them, or need any other gear or accessories to enjoy them. If edibles aren’t your style, another easy to use and discrete option is a vape cartridge with cannabis distillate inside! Just don’t forget to order a battery.[/p]","storeplNeighbourhood":null,"storervwAssociateID":"BIZ:a092cd3e-6aa7-4a14-960e-e0bc1f47c26f","storervwCount":11,"storervwAverage":"5.0","storemedia":{},"storedeals":[{"dlsDealsID":"DLS:4b540314-b1a8-41ea-8ba6-343a14dfb4fa","dlsUserID":"USR:94c281a9-c585-4915-b1cc-d2754d50357e","dlsBusinessID":null,"dlsName":"EVERYDAY $100 OUNCE DEAL AND FREE FLOWERS!","dlsSlug":"everyday-100-ounce-deal-and-free-flowers","dlsDescription":"OUNCE SPECIALS\r\n- GUARANTEED EVERYDAY $100 OUNCE SPECIAL!\r\n\r\nFIRST TIME BONUS\r\n- All new customers will get 10% OFF on their first online order along with a Mystery Box on your next order (3.5g of flower).\r\n\r\nREFERRAL PROGRAM\r\n-  REFER A FRIEND, YOU AND YOUR FRIEND WILL BOTH ELIGIBLE FOR A FREE 3.5 GRAM!\r\n\r\nLOYALTY PROGRAM\r\n- RECEIVE UP TO 6.2% CASH BACK AND REWARD ITEM SUCH AS FREE IPAD, AIRPOD PRO AND MUCH MORE!\r\n\r\nORDER NOW VIA TEXT/CALL: 4372137996 OR VISIT US AT WWW.HIGHESTFARMACY.COM","dlsExpireDate":"2021-04-20 00:00:00","dlsInstructions":"ORDER NOW VIA TEXT/CALL: 4372137996 OR VISIT US AT WWW.HIGHESTFARMACY.COM","dlsApplyTo":"Storewide","dlsCreationDate":"2021-02-24 20:50:55","dlsLastModifiedDate":"2021-04-12 20:22:19","dlsPublishDate":null,"pivot":{"linkBusinessID":"BIZ:a092cd3e-6aa7-4a14-960e-e0bc1f47c26f","linkDealsID":"DLS:4b540314-b1a8-41ea-8ba6-343a14dfb4fa"}}]},"storepinURL":"/images/mappin/delivery_3.png","storebizLogo":"https://dz8osaahf9pd7.cloudfront.net/filters:format(webp)/storage/images/5f3f4a7059283.png","storebizLocation":"Barrie, ON","storebizRoute":"https://www.leafythings.com/weed-delivery/on/barrie/highest-farmacy4"},{"business":{"storeId":"BIZ:bd178ca9-45b0-41cf-b049-668f73618ed5","storeTypeId":1,"storeName":"Laughing Buda","storeHasDeals":1,"storeIsVerified":0,"storeIsFeatured":1,"storeFeaturedPosition":3,"storeLatitude":43.921869,"storeLongitude":-80.085512,"storeplBusinessTypeID":1,"storeplType":"Delivery","storeplCategory":null,"storeplSlug":"orangeville","storeplSortOrder":3,"storeplRegionID":36,"storeplProvinceID":1,"storeplName":"Orangeville","storeplLatitude":43.91817494,"storeplLongitude":-80.09857178,"storeplDescription":null,"storeplDescription2":null,"storeplNeighbourhood":null,"storervwAssociateID":"BIZ:bd178ca9-45b0-41cf-b049-668f73618ed5","storervwCount":9,"storervwAverage":"4.6","storemedia":{},"storedeals":[{"dlsDealsID":"DLS:7bc944a8-0277-4f74-be91-190a8dabd5ce","dlsUserID":"USR:82940fc4-bccf-4027-a93d-4360b4601a3e","dlsBusinessID":null,"dlsName":"Free edible or shatter for referalls","dlsSlug":"free-edible-or-shatter-for-referalls","dlsDescription":"refer a  new customer and recieve a free edible or shatter on your next purchase","dlsExpireDate":"2021-04-12 00:00:00","dlsInstructions":"text us","dlsApplyTo":"Storewide","dlsCreationDate":"2021-03-12 13:59:03","dlsLastModifiedDate":"2021-03-12 13:59:04","dlsPublishDate":"2021-03-12 00:00:00","pivot":{"linkBusinessID":"BIZ:bd178ca9-45b0-41cf-b049-668f73618ed5","linkDealsID":"DLS:7bc944a8-0277-4f74-be91-190a8dabd5ce"}}]},"storepinURL":"/images/mappin/delivery_3.png","storebizLogo":"https://dz8osaahf9pd7.cloudfront.net/filters:format(webp)/storage/images/5fc18c81dc39a.png","storebizLocation":"Orangeville, ON","storebizRoute":"https://www.leafythings.com/weed-delivery/on/orangeville/laughing-buda"},{"business":{"storeId":"BIZ:102cff21-bd7f-45b5-b125-37a6ec23ff64","storeTypeId":1,"storeName":"Canna corp","storeHasDeals":1,"storeIsVerified":0,"storeIsFeatured":1,"storeFeaturedPosition":3,"storeLatitude":44.14922049,"storeLongitude":-79.87808874,"storeplBusinessTypeID":1,"storeplType":"Delivery","storeplCategory":null,"storeplSlug":"alliston","storeplSortOrder":3,"storeplRegionID":85,"storeplProvinceID":1,"storeplName":"Alliston","storeplLatitude":44.1539369,"storeplLongitude":-79.8692321,"storeplDescription":"[p]You will be surprised to see how many people are ordering marijuana products and enjoying same-day cannabis delivery in Alliston nowadays.

However, with the weed delivery companies that we feature on Leafy Things, you’d never know it! You can get the same, high quality cannabis products that customers in the bigger cities are getting, delivered right to your door. Here’s how it all works. [/p]","storeplDescription2":"[h2] How Does Weed Delivery in Barrie Work? [/h2][p] Currently, we feature almost two dozen weed delivery companies on Leafythings that serve Barrie, Ontario and any peripheral towns. Once you select a company from one of our featured listings, you’ll be able to view their entire menu of products. Once you’ve decided on a purchase, just click through to visit their website or call by phone to place the order. During the order process, you’ll need to provide your Barrie address to be delivered to. Some companies even offer same day delivery for when you really need it! If you order from a company that doesn’t offer same day delivery, you can expect your order in a day or two, delivered straight to your door in a discrete, smell proof package. Last step? Enjoy! That’s how easy it is. [/p][h2] Okay, but What Weed do I Order? [/h2][p] This is a tough question for us to answer for you! Cannabis preferences can be both highly subjective and personal. However - we can definitely tell you what other people like you in Barrie usually enjoy and like to purchase, and that is a great place to start! High quality flower is a bit of a specialty for the area, so strains such as Do Si Dos, OG Kush and Gorilla Glue are often crowd favourites. Folks in Barrie also really enjoy delicious cannabis infused edibles such as gummies and chocolates. These are two great ways to get your cannabis since you don’t need to smoke them, or need any other gear or accessories to enjoy them. If edibles aren’t your style, another easy to use and discrete option is a vape cartridge with cannabis distillate inside! Just don’t forget to order a battery.[/p]","storeplNeighbourhood":null,"storervwAssociateID":"BIZ:5b149f8c-6608-4c8f-ba62-1e0bf727bac0","storervwCount":1,"storervwAverage":"5.0","storemedia":{},"storedeals":[{"dlsDealsID":"DLS:bcb092b8-876c-4acd-b06b-1e02163a64b5","dlsUserID":"USR:5b36552b-6835-4642-8c35-268204eb40e9","dlsBusinessID":null,"dlsName":"Thursday thrills   and deals","dlsSlug":"thursday-thrills-and-deals","dlsDescription":"carts flower deals they are all here check us out","dlsExpireDate":"2021-03-29 00:00:00","dlsInstructions":"simply call us or text us :)","dlsApplyTo":"Storewide","dlsCreationDate":"2021-03-25 16:59:36","dlsLastModifiedDate":"2021-03-25 16:59:36","dlsPublishDate":"2021-03-25 00:00:00","pivot":{"linkBusinessID":"BIZ:5b149f8c-6608-4c8f-ba62-1e0bf727bac0","linkDealsID":"DLS:bcb092b8-876c-4acd-b06b-1e02163a64b5"}}]},"storepinURL":"/images/mappin/delivery_5.png","storebizLogo":"https://dz8osaahf9pd7.cloudfront.net/filters:format(webp)/storage/images/6075ff47c6c81.png","storebizLocation":"Barrie, ON","storebizRoute":"https://www.leafythings.com/weed-delivery/on/barrie/heavenly-high-duplicate-barrie"},{"business":{"storeId":"BIZ:943a3c8d-0337-42c3-8f30-2034b0d91a87","storeTypeId":1,"storeName":"Topshelfmeds","storeHasDeals":1,"storeIsVerified":0,"storeIsFeatured":1,"storeFeaturedPosition":7,"storeLatitude":43.92087799,"storeLongitude":-80.08793794,"storeplBusinessTypeID":1,"storeplType":"Delivery","storeplCategory":null,"storeplSlug":"orangeville","storeplSortOrder":3,"storeplRegionID":36,"storeplProvinceID":1,"storeplName":"Orangeville","storeplLatitude":43.91817494,"storeplLongitude":-80.09857178,"storeplDescription":null,"storeplDescription2":null,"storeplNeighbourhood":null,"storervwAssociateID":null,"storervwCount":null,"storervwAverage":null,"storemedia":{},"storedeals":[{"dlsDealsID":"DLS:8e8b17fb-3a30-4cc6-a0b0-55b411770641","dlsUserID":"USR:4457c927-7185-4799-a34c-3db693a608c5","dlsBusinessID":null,"dlsName":"$25 distillate cubes","dlsSlug":"25-distillate-cubes2","dlsDescription":"500mg distillate cubes on sale for $25 per pack","dlsExpireDate":"2021-04-28 00:00:00","dlsInstructions":"Text or email","dlsApplyTo":"Edibles","dlsCreationDate":"2021-03-29 19:25:46","dlsLastModifiedDate":"2021-03-29 19:28:53","dlsPublishDate":"2021-03-29 00:00:00","pivot":{"linkBusinessID":"BIZ:943a3c8d-0337-42c3-8f30-2034b0d91a87","linkDealsID":"DLS:8e8b17fb-3a30-4cc6-a0b0-55b411770641"},"business":[{"bizBusinessID":"BIZ:1d467839-6b14-4fc8-9b91-5730e0c72a71","bizUserID":"USR:4457c927-7185-4799-a34c-3db693a608c5","bizBusinessTypeID":1,"bizName":"Topshelfmeds","bizSlug":"topshelfmeds5","bizPhone":"6475286329","bizEmailAddress":"delivery@topshelfmeds.ca","bizRegionID":37,"bizRegistrationIP":"70.26.22.162","bizPostal":"L6W1Y7","bizStreetAddress":null,"bizIntersection":null,"bizLicenseNumber":null,"bizDescription":"<p>We offer high quality THC and CBD products priced to please every smoker.

However, with the weed delivery companies that we feature on Leafy Things, you’d never know it! You can get the same, high quality cannabis products that customers in the bigger cities are getting, delivered right to your door. Here’s how it all works. [/p]","storeplDescription2":"[h2] How Does Weed Delivery in Barrie Work? [/h2][p] Currently, we feature almost two dozen weed delivery companies on Leafythings that serve Barrie, Ontario and any peripheral towns. Once you select a company from one of our featured listings, you’ll be able to view their entire menu of products. Once you’ve decided on a purchase, just click through to visit their website or call by phone to place the order. During the order process, you’ll need to provide your Barrie address to be delivered to. Some companies even offer same day delivery for when you really need it! If you order from a company that doesn’t offer same day delivery, you can expect your order in a day or two, delivered straight to your door in a discrete, smell proof package. Last step? Enjoy! That’s how easy it is. [/p][h2] Okay, but What Weed do I Order? [/h2][p] This is a tough question for us to answer for you! Cannabis preferences can be both highly subjective and personal. However - we can definitely tell you what other people like you in Barrie usually enjoy and like to purchase, and that is a great place to start! High quality flower is a bit of a specialty for the area, so strains such as Do Si Dos, OG Kush and Gorilla Glue are often crowd favourites. Folks in Barrie also really enjoy delicious cannabis infused edibles such as gummies and chocolates. These are two great ways to get your cannabis since you don’t need to smoke them, or need any other gear or accessories to enjoy them. If edibles aren’t your style, another easy to use and discrete option is a vape cartridge with cannabis distillate inside! Just don’t forget to order a battery.[/p]","storeplNeighbourhood":null,"storervwAssociateID":null,"storervwCount":null,"storervwAverage":null,"storemedia":{},"storedeals":[{"dlsDealsID":"DLS:396f873e-64a0-4652-852d-ed6fa04e1ebe","dlsUserID":"USR:94c281a9-c585-4915-b1cc-d2754d50357e","dlsBusinessID":null,"dlsName":"$90 OUNCE DEAL!","dlsSlug":"90-ounce-deal2","dlsDescription":"GET THE BEST DEAL OUT OF HERE! \r\nGET OUR PREMIUM OUNCE DEAL NOW FOR ONLY $90 AN OUNCE!\r\nUSE CODE: TVB90\r\nORDER NOW AT WWW.TREESBYVANCITY.COM OR TEXT US AT (416) 729-6848 TO REDEEM YOUR OFFER!","dlsExpireDate":"2021-04-30 00:00:00","dlsInstructions":"USE CODE: TVB90\r\nORDER NOW AT WWW.TREESBYVANCITY.COM OR TEXT US AT (416) 729-6848 TO REDEEM YOUR OFFER!","dlsApplyTo":"Storewide","dlsCreationDate":"2021-04-08 17:51:08","dlsLastModifiedDate":"2021-04-08 17:51:09","dlsPublishDate":"2021-04-08 00:00:00","pivot":{"linkBusinessID":"BIZ:e426bbbf-1d2c-4539-bae9-5f6e3a801466","linkDealsID":"DLS:396f873e-64a0-4652-852d-ed6fa04e1ebe"}}]},"storepinURL":"/images/mappin/delivery_6.png","storebizLogo":"https://dz8osaahf9pd7.cloudfront.net/filters:format(webp)/storage/images/5f404d8d088b0.png","storebizLocation":"Barrie, ON","storebizRoute":"https://www.leafythings.com/weed-delivery/on/barrie/trees-by-vancity16"},{"business":{"storeId":"BIZ:d655e16c-4a75-46a2-9618-1de162bd60c4","storeTypeId":1,"storeName":"Trees by Vancity","storeHasDeals":1,"storeIsVerified":0,"storeIsFeatured":0,"storeFeaturedPosition":255,"storeLatitude":44.10088088,"storeLongitude":-79.57644802,"storeplBusinessTypeID":1,"storeplType":"Delivery","storeplCategory":null,"storeplSlug":"bradford-west-gwillimbury","storeplSortOrder":3,"storeplRegionID":38,"storeplProvinceID":1,"storeplName":"Bradford West Gwillimbury","storeplLatitude":44.10977494,"storeplLongitude":-79.57672119,"storeplDescription":"[p]Checking out cannabis delivery services in Bradford, Ontario?
